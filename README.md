# Navy Jones's Portfolio Website

### This project is my personal portfolio website. My goal for this was to be able to show my skills as a developer, showcase some of my projects, as well as give a little insight on who I am.

### I created this website using React and bootstrap for styling/layout. I also incorporated EmailJS for handling the contact form information and emailing me the messages. For my host I chose to use AWS Amplify, it seemed like the best choice for my case since I wanted to use my custom domain and their isn't any back-end code that would need to run on a server.
